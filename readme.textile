h1. Coloured Balls


As below, but with changes by team 2 at late May London Clojure Dojo.



This is a modified version of the code produced by Team 5 at the
early-May 2011 London Clojure Dojo.  I missed that dojo, and
picked up the code to have a play.  The changes I've made are
mostly trivial, and are mostly aimed at making things easier for me
to understand.  I would probably not defend many of the changes as
being improvements -- in most cases it's just that at my current
stage of learning Clojure the changes makes things easier for me to
read the code.

Bruce Durling asked me to post to the group to say what changes I'd
made, so here it is.

The new file
    london-clojure-dojo-coloured-balls-early-may-2011-team-5-sk-changes.html
in the top-level directory shows the original and new
.../src/coloured_balls/core.clj files side-by-side so it's easy to
see the changes I made.

I've marked the changes with comments containing "sk-change:" (without
the quotes), and included explanations.

The only files changed are:
    readme.textile (this file)
    project.clj
    .../src/coloured_balls/core.clj
